It has marked a generational shift in global societies’ social organizations, supply chains, and economies - and much is left that is still yet uncertain. At the time of writing, going on 9 months since the first major lockdowns began, it continues to feel like the world is primed to change faster than we can plan for. In light of this dilemma, what tools do we have at our disposal to fight back against this looming uncertainty? It is our belief that knowledge and information are our greatest assets to meet the coming challenges with. If we can confidently capture and track the trends emerging from this pandemic, we can identify knock on effects and externalities that will result. The bridge between data/information and knowledge and wisdom is - in our opinion - explanation. Armed with knowledge about the micro-scale mechanics of the disease itself, and the macro-scale trends of its trends in cases, deaths, and recoveries - we can transform raw information into empowering knowledge. As renowned quantum-physicist David Deutsch puts it, “The ability to create and use explanatory knowledge gives people a power to transform nature which is ultimately not limited by parochial factors, as all other adaptations are, but only by universal laws.” All this said, given the impact this pandemic has already wrought, there is a glut of publicized analysis already freely available. We are in danger of drowning out the signal in the noise. It is this group’s intention to add to the ultimate understanding for readers, rather than present redundant or additionally cacophonous echoes. Our approach is to keep the conclusions as straightforward as possible, to make our visualizations intuitive, simple, and educational rather than highly technical or idiosyncratic. Also, in our investigation of other outlets for this analysis, we note that there is little capability of comparing national curves on the fly; one tends to need to look at one chart and then another rather than being able to compare side by side in a customizable plot. This is something we are interested in adding to the community in our interactive plot section. "]]
