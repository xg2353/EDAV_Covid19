[["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results The graph above shows the number of confirmed cases of the five countries with the most confirmed cases. The five countries are United States, India, Brazil, Russia, and France. From the graph, we see that the slope of the lines for all five countries (except Russia) do not plateau but rather increases, meaning that the spread of the pandemic is getting worse and worse. The graph above shows the number of recovered cases of the five countries with the most recovered cases. We see the same five countries, United States, India, Brazil, Russia, and France. Even though the top five countries are the same, there are more recovered cases in India and Brazil compared to the United States. This is somewhat unexpected since US exceeded India and Brazil in the number of confirmed cases by approximately 3 million and 6 million, yet there are much fewer recovered cases in the United States. The graph above shows the number of deaths of the five countries with the most deaths. As we saw from the previous graph of the confirmed cases, we can see that the US, India, and Brazil have made the top 3 here again since more confirmed cases would naturally lead to more deaths. One interesting thing that we see here is that Mexico, which seemed to have not as many cases as US, India, or Brazil, shows a high number of deaths. The plot above is the dot plot of the world map representing number of deaths in each country. As we have discovered from the previous paragraph, we can see that the top three countries, the United States, India, and Brazil display bright blue dots. We are now looking at the cases per death "]]
