*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.*	


*Also in this repo:*
- R workbooks for data sources, data transformation, missing value analysis, results, interactive visualizations, and conclusions
- A data subdirectory including some of the preprocessed and derivative files from our raw dataset. This includes: tidy versions of the confirmed, recovered, and confirmed case datasets, and time series for each of the 3 as well
