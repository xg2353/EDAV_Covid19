# Conclusion

In this project, we use time series line charts, map, grouped bar chart and Cleveland dot plot to visualize the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, we select representative countries/regions that top the charts to explore. This is due to the limitation of certain graphs that cannot accommodate two many variables. For example, we selected the top 5 countries to plot in time series line charts in terms of their confirmed cases, recovered cases and deaths. Choosing a few number of selective countries/regions, instead of all 269 countries, to plot will avoid clustering/overlapping in the graph which can be very messy. However, this is a trade-off between generality and information about other countries/regions.
